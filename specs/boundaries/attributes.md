# Attributes

Version: 0.1.0-draft

## Date Columns

| Column     | Type                    | Notes                                                                 |
| ---------- | ----------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `valid_on` | timestamp with timezone | When this version of the data was last updated                        |
| `valid_to` | timestamp               | When this version was superseded; null if this is the current version |

All rows in a file SHOULD share the same `valid_on` and `valid_to` values (dates are constant per layer). `valid_on` MUST be non-null. `valid_to` MUST be null for the current (latest) version of a dataset and non-null for retired versions.

> **Note:** `valid_to` has inconsistent timezone handling in existing data (some files store it as timestamp with timezone, others as timestamp without). New data SHOULD use timestamp with timezone consistently.

## Computed Columns

| Column       | Type   | Notes                                                         |
| ------------ | ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `area_sqkm`  | double | Area of the polygon in square kilometres                      |
| `center_lat` | double | Latitude of a representative point guaranteed within polygon  |
| `center_lon` | double | Longitude of a representative point guaranteed within polygon |

These values are computed from the geometry. `area_sqkm` is computed in an equal-area projection (EPSG:6933). `center_lat` and `center_lon` are geographic coordinates (EPSG:4326) of a point guaranteed to be within the polygon.

`center_lat` and `center_lon` SHOULD be generated using a Maximum Inscribed Circle (MIC) algorithm, which finds the largest circle that fits inside the polygon and uses its center as the representative point. Implementations include DuckDB's [`ST_MaximumInscribedCircle`](https://duckdb.org/docs/stable/core_extensions/spatial/functions#st_maximuminscribedcircle) and GeoPandas' [`GeoSeries.maximum_inscribed_circle`](https://geopandas.org/en/stable/docs/reference/api/geopandas.GeoSeries.maximum_inscribed_circle.html). Many existing datasets use a simple centroid instead, which does not guarantee that the point falls within the polygon (e.g. for concave or donut-shaped polygons).

## Identifier Columns (Admin 0 only)

These columns are present only on admin level 0 files:

| Column | Type   | Max length | Notes                                       |
| ------ | ------ | ---------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| `iso2` | string | 2          | ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 country code, e.g. `AF`  |
| `iso3` | string | 3          | ISO 3166-1 alpha-3 country code, e.g. `AFG` |

> **Note:** `iso2` and `iso3` appear only in admin 0 files in current data. They SHOULD be included in higher admin levels to keep schemas consistent.

## Reference Name Column (Deprecated)

> **Deprecated:** The `adm{N}_ref_name` column (also seen as `adm{N}_ref_name1`) is deprecated and SHOULD NOT be included in new datasets. Existing data containing this column MUST NOT cause parsers to fail, but it should be omitted going forward.

| Column            | Type   | Notes                                                              |
| ----------------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `adm{N}_ref_name` | string | Romanized or UN official reference name for the current-level unit |

This column, when present, contains the preferred reference name for the administrative unit at the current level (level N). It is typically the romanized Latin-script form when the primary script is non-Latin. Only the current level's ref name is included, not ancestors.
